# unCHK

## Presentation

This simple script tries to identify the file type based on the mime-type of the file and renames it accordingly.

## Usage

  ./repair-CHK.sh <dir> to be repaired

## File Types

The list of correspondances is based on the USB keys I have had to repair.

One case must nevertheless be mentionned :
The `.office` file type does not exist. The script renames a file like this, when the file cannot be identified for certain, but seems to be a file type provided by microsoft office suite.

The list of correspondances can be improved, feel free to do so.

Hoping this will help somebody else repair it's USB sticks once windows bullied it.
